# Contributing

I love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/circuitbreakers.git

Make sure the tests pass:

    ./gradlew check

Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass:

    ./gradlew check

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

At this point you're waiting on me. I'll try to respond quickly. I may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow Java language style conventions.
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
