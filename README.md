# Duct Tape

> Duct Tape is a little Java 8 library providing fault tolerance support for code that calls external APIs and
  unreliable components, including those that may fail, time out, or return inconsistent results.

This library was formerly named `circuitbreakers`, but given the inclusion of more general purpose fault tolerance
features, it was renamed.
